                <p>
                    Annoyance, exasperation, irritation, frustration. For most of us, these feelings are part of the ever-changing emotional weather of day-to-day life. How often, on a given day, do you find yourself swallowing down resentment or frustration? Or biting your tongue in order to smooth over conflict in social settings, at work or at home?

                    But according to some experts, female fury is at epidemic proportions. Mike Fisher, psychotherapist and founder of the British Association of Anger Management, has observed this trend in his decades of experience in the field. Some years ago, his organisation carried out a study in which they surveyed over 12,000 people. "What I identified is that women are much angrier than men," he says.
                    
                    He's not the only one to have noticed it. Writer and broadcaster Soraya Chemaly tapped into a little-acknowledged wellspring when her book about women and anger, Rage Becomes Her, became a global phenomenon when it was published last year.
                    
                    So what is behind this tidal wave of rage? According to clinical psychologist Dr Malie Coyne, studies suggest there are some common routes to anger for women, most notably feelings of powerlessness or injustice.
                    
                    Gender inequality in society, the workplace and the home play a huge part.
                    
                    "Women are paid less, they aren't as valued in the workplace, when they hit glass ceilings it's very hard for them to earn more than that. In many ways it's still a man's world," says Mike Fisher.
                    
                    For many women, this imbalance continues into the domestic sphere. "When a woman is working and she comes home from work, she feels she has to do so much more than the man does," says Fisher.
